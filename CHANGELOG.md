### What's Changed

* **Proxy-mode connectivity** (#195) - Brokers now advertise separate `broker_url` (internal identity) and `connect_url` (client-facing proxy address) via the new `advertised_listeners` config section. When a gRPC proxy or Kubernetes ingress sits in front of the cluster, the client automatically inserts an `x-danube-broker-url` metadata header on every RPC so the proxy can route to the correct backend broker. by @danrusei in 807317a

### 🏗️ Broker Internals

* **Dispatcher refactor** (#194) - Consolidated the 3-layer enum hierarchy (`Dispatcher` → `ExclusiveDispatcher`/`SharedDispatcher` → leaf variants) into a single flat `Dispatcher` struct with four factory constructors. Eliminates ~300 lines of duplicated facade methods and match delegation. Pure structural change with no behavior change. by @danrusei in fbab80d

* **Background subscription cleanup** (#193) - Moved expired subscription removal to a background task instead of performing it inline during packet dispatch, reducing latency on the hot path. by @danrusei in 6df5816

### 📦 Client Improvements

* **Builders return Result instead of panicking** (#190) - `DanubeClient`, `ProducerBuilder`, and `ConsumerBuilder` now return `Result` from `.build()` instead of panicking on misconfiguration. by @danrusei in 7affa8c

* **Centralized retry/backoff logic** (#190) - Unified retry strategy across producers and consumers, replacing scattered inline retry loops. by @danrusei in 7affa8c

* **State machines for TopicConsumer/TopicProducer** (#190) - Refactored connection lifecycle into explicit state machines for clearer error handling and reconnection behavior. by @danrusei in 7affa8c

* **Schema registry ergonomics** (#190, #191) - Consolidated schema registry operations within the Danube client and removed references to `ErrorType`/`ErrorMessage` in favor of idiomatic error handling. by @danrusei in 7affa8c, 8c5df69

* **Client resilience fixes** (#192) - Resolve operations now return errors instead of panicking; consumers read the `stop_signal` field from health checks for graceful shutdown. by @danrusei in c6c9f8c

🎉 **AI-Native Cluster Management**

Danube now integrates with AI assistants via Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling natural language cluster management. We've also consolidated admin binaries into a unified tool.

### 🤖 AI & MCP Integration

* **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** (#185) - 40+ tools and 7 guided prompts for natural language cluster management through Claude Desktop, Windsurf, VSCode, and other MCP-compatible IDEs. by @danrusei in 7c9bc2a

* **Enhanced Tool Documentation** (#187) - Detailed MCP tool descriptions with usage guidance, parameter explanations, and configuration requirements. by @danrusei in d2b3979

### 🔧 Binary Consolidation

* **Unified danube-admin** (#184) - Merged CLI and gateway into single binary with three modes (CLI, HTTP server, MCP). 40% smaller, ~400 lines of duplicate code eliminated. by @danrusei in f534b77

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* Allow manual rebalancing when auto-rebalance is disabled (#189) by @danrusei in 680dc88
* Fixed topic distribution calculation affecting load balancing (#186) by @danrusei in ecae3a9
* Simplified Docker folder structure by @danrusei in b953138

## v0.7.0 - 2026-01-27

### 🎯 Major Features

* **Automated Cluster Rebalancing** (#182) - Proactive rebalancing using Coefficient of Variation (CV) metrics with configurable aggressiveness levels (Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive), rate limiting, cooldown periods, and topic blacklist support. Automatically moves topics between brokers to maintain optimal cluster balance. by @danrusei in b9bafbd

* **Intelligent Ranking Algorithms** (#181, #183) - Three topic assignment strategies: Fair (topic count), Balanced (multi-factor scoring with topic load + CPU + memory), and WeightedLoad (adaptive bottleneck detection). Topic load now considers message rate, throughput, connections, and backlog for smarter broker selection. by @danrusei in 85b896c, ae1a0b3

* **Cross-Platform Resource Monitoring** (#180) - System resource monitoring with automatic container detection (Docker/K8s) and cgroup-aware metrics. Tracks CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network I/O in real-time for accurate load calculations. by @danrusei in 7eeda83

<!-- v0.6.1 START -->
## v0.6.1 - 2026-01-06

This release completes the Schema Registry implementation with distributed schema ID generation, producer-level validation, and topic-level schema governance.

### 🔧 Schema Registry Enhancements

* **Distributed Schema ID Generation** - Replaced local counters with ETCD-based atomic counters, eliminating ID collisions in multi-broker environments. Added reverse index (`schema_id → subject`) for efficient consumer schema lookups via `get_schema_by_id()`.

* **Producer Schema Validation** - Enhanced producer creation to validate schema subjects. First producer assigns schema to topic; subsequent producers must use the same subject. Exported `SchemaRegistrationBuilder` from `danube-client` for improved API ergonomics.

* **Topic-Level Schema Governance** - Implemented admin APIs (`ConfigureTopicSchema`, `UpdateTopicValidationPolicy`, `GetTopicSchemaConfig`) enabling per-topic validation policies. Multiple topics can share the same schema subject while enforcing different validation rules (e.g., `Warn` for dev, `Enforce` for prod). All configurations persist to ETCD.

<!-- v0.6.0 START -->
## v0.6.0 - 2026-01-04

This release introduces the **Schema Registry** with full compatibility checking, reliability improvements for at-least-once delivery guarantees, and significant refactoring for maintainability.

### 🎯 Major Features

* **Schema Registry with JSON Schema Compatibility** (#166) - Implemented backward, forward, and full compatibility checking for JSON Schema in `danube-broker/src/schema/json/`. Complements existing Avro support. by @danrusei in 81ddac7

* **Complete Schema Registry Implementation** (#165) - Added centralized schema management with versioning, compatibility enforcement (Backward/Forward/Full/None modes), and support for JSON Schema, Avro, and Protobuf. See [Schema Registry Architecture](https://danube-docs.dev-state.com/architecture/schema_registry_architecture/) for details. by @danrusei in 6c6571a

### 🔧 Reliability & Performance

* **Hybrid Lag Monitor for At-Least-Once Delivery** (#162) - Implemented a dual-path dispatch system combining fast notification-based delivery with a 500ms heartbeat watchdog. Ensures reliable message delivery even when `tokio::Notify` coalescing, subscription races, consumer disconnects, or storage lags occur. Guarantees at-least-once delivery semantics. by @danrusei in 6f334b1

### 🏗️ Refactoring & Code Quality

* **Dispatcher Refactoring** (#164) - Restructured `danube-broker/src/dispatcher/` for improved readability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. by @danrusei in a05c5de

* **Consumer Lifecycle Simplification** (#161) - Introduced `ConsumerSession` to manage consumer state and lifecycle, simplifying connection handling and session management in `danube-broker/src/consumer.rs`. by @danrusei in ef70cd0
