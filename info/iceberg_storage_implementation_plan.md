# Danube Iceberg Storage Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for replacing Danube's segment-based persistent storage with Apache Iceberg-native storage, enabling cloud-native architecture with analytics integration.

## Current Status: In Progress (MVP gaps identified)

The Iceberg storage implementation is partially complete and compiles, but several functional gaps remain before it can deliver end-to-end persistence and consumption with ACID guarantees. The README currently indicates parts are "In Progress" and the code corroborates that critical areas are still placeholders (see Gap Analysis below).

## Architecture Summary

### Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Pattern
- **Fast producer acknowledgments** with sub-millisecond WAL writes
- **Asynchronous background processing** to Iceberg tables
- **File rotation and integrity checks** with CRC32 validation
- **Configurable sync modes** for durability vs. performance trade-offs
- **Continuous reading** for background processing

### Full Iceberg Integration 
- **Production-ready catalog clients** for AWS Glue and REST catalogs
- **Atomic snapshot commits** with proper table metadata management
- **Structured schema** with Arrow/Parquet format optimized for Danube messages
- **Object store abstraction** supporting S3 and local filesystem
- **Batch processing** with configurable size and time limits
- **Streaming reads** with incremental snapshot processing
- **Table lifecycle management** with automatic creation and namespace handling

### Cloud-Native Architecture
- **Stateless brokers** with shared Iceberg storage layer
- **Horizontal scalability** through cloud object storage
- **Multi-cloud support** (AWS S3, local filesystem, extensible to GCS/Azure)
- **Background processing** decoupled from producer path
- **Analytics integration** through Iceberg-compatible query engines
- **Graceful shutdown** with proper resource cleanup

## Gap Analysis

- [High] WAL reader not implemented
  - `danube-iceberg-storage/src/wal.rs`: `WalReader::read_next()` and `seek()` are TODO. `SyncMode::Periodic` not implemented.
  - Effect: `TopicWriter` cannot actually tail WAL; ingestion path is not end-to-end.

- [High] Consumer stream wiring missing
  - `danube-iceberg-storage/src/iceberg_storage.rs`: `create_message_stream()` returns a receiver that is not connected to `TopicReader` output (TODO).
  - Effect: consumers will not receive data.

- [High] Hardcoded object store and paths
  - `topic_writer.rs`: table location hardcoded to `s3://danube-data/{topic}`; does not use configured `warehouse` or object store.
  - `topic_reader.rs`: always uses `LocalFileSystem`; ignores configured object store.
  - Effect: configuration for S3/MinIO/local is ineffective or inconsistent.

- [High] Writer/Reader configs not applied
  - `topic_writer.rs`: ignores `WriterConfig` (batch size, flush interval, memory cap).
  - `topic_reader.rs`: ignores `ReaderConfig` (poll interval, concurrency, prefetch).
  - Effect: no control over batching, timeouts, or resource usage.

- [High] Iceberg commit protocol not implemented
  - `catalog/rest_catalog.rs`: `update_table()` posts entire metadata; not the Iceberg REST commit/branch reference update with optimistic concurrency.
  - `catalog/glue_catalog.rs`: CRUD resembles Hive Glue tables; not Iceberg commit semantics.
  - `topic_writer.rs`: synthesizes `Snapshot` and pushes to in-memory metadata; no manifests/manifest lists; not atomic.
  - Effect: no ACID guarantees; unsafe concurrency across writers.

- [High] Reader incremental processing and Parquet reading missing
  - `topic_reader.rs`: generates dummy messages; `read_parquet_file()` placeholder; no manifest parsing or incremental scan.
  - Effect: consumers cannot read actual data files.

- [Medium] Committed position tracking unimplemented
  - `iceberg_storage.rs`: `get_committed_position()` returns 0 (TODO).
  - Effect: broker cannot report progress or resume correctly.

- [Medium] Topic deletion incomplete
  - `iceberg_storage.rs`: `delete_topic()` does not drop table or clean object store paths.

- [Medium] Catalog auth and resiliency
  - REST token header not used; no retry/backoff. Glue profile handling not explicit.

- [Medium] etcd integration for subscription progress
  - Design calls for persisting last processed snapshot/offset; current code keeps state in-memory only.

- [Low] Schema evolution support
  - Static schema via `create_danube_schema()`; no evolution workflow.

- [Low] Metrics/monitoring
  - No counters or tracing for latency, batch sizes, failures, snapshot lag, etc.

- [Low] Retention/compaction/maintenance
  - No policies for snapshot retention or data compaction.

- [Low] Tests/benchmarks and Parquet tuning
  - Lack of integration tests (REST/MinIO) and performance harness; no compression/encoding tuning.

## Recommended Actions (Prioritized)

1) Implement WAL reading and periodic fsync
- Implement `WalReader::read_next()` and `seek()`; support `SyncMode::Periodic` in `WriteAheadLog`.

2) Wire consumer streams end-to-end
- In `IcebergStorage`, maintain per-topic fan-out/broadcast from `TopicReader` to registered subscribers, and return connected receivers from `create_message_stream()`.

3) Honor configuration and remove hardcoded paths
- Pass configured `ObjectStore` to `TopicReader`.
- Use `IcebergConfig.warehouse` to derive table and data paths; no hardcoded `s3://...` in `TopicWriter`.
- Apply `WriterConfig` and `ReaderConfig` values for batch size, flush interval, memory cap, poll interval, concurrency, and prefetch.

4) Implement proper Iceberg REST commit protocol (initial target)
- Stage data files and manifests; build manifest list.
- Perform atomic reference update with optimistic concurrency via REST catalog.
- For Glue, document limitation or route commits through a REST catalog service.

5) Implement reader incremental scan and Parquet conversion
- Parse manifest list/manifests to enumerate added data files since last processed snapshot.
- Read Parquet via `object_store`, convert Arrow -> `StreamMessage`, and stream to subscribers.

6) Track committed positions and integrate etcd for subscription progress
- Persist last processed snapshot/offset per subscription in etcd.
- Implement `get_committed_position()` using Iceberg metadata and/or etcd state.

7) Complete topic deletion and add catalog/auth resiliency
- Implement `delete_topic()` to drop table and optionally purge warehouse prefixes.
- Add REST token auth header support; AWS profile/credentials selection; retries with backoff for transient failures.

8) Productionization items
- Metrics/monitoring, schema evolution workflow, retention/compaction policies, integration tests (REST + MinIO), performance benchmarks, Parquet compression/encoding settings.

## Progress Update (2025-09-13)

- Implemented the first two high-priority items:
  - WAL reader and periodic fsync:
    - `danube-iceberg-storage/src/wal.rs`: Implemented `WalReader::read_next()` and `seek()` to iterate `wal-*.log` files in order, read fixed-size headers (16 bytes), validate CRC32, and deserialize `WalEntry`. Added time-based periodic `sync_data()` when `SyncMode::Periodic` is enabled. Introduced `last_sync_ms` in `WriteAheadLog`.
    - Fixed `WalEntryHeader::SIZE` to 16 to match two `u32` + one `u64` encoded by bincode.
  - Consumer stream wiring:
    - `danube-iceberg-storage/src/topic_reader.rs`: Switched to `tokio::sync::broadcast::Sender<StreamMessage>` for fan-out to multiple subscribers; updated send path. Kept shutdown as `mpsc::Receiver<()>`.
    - `danube-iceberg-storage/src/iceberg_storage.rs`: Created per-topic broadcast channels stored in `message_senders`; `create_message_stream()` now subscribes to the broadcast and bridges to an `mpsc::Receiver<StreamMessage>` returned to callers. Background `TopicReader` publishes to the topic broadcast.

- Implemented configuration-driven behavior:
  - Honor configuration and remove hardcoded paths:
    - `danube-iceberg-storage/src/topic_writer.rs`: Table location now derived from `IcebergConfig.warehouse` instead of a hardcoded S3 URI. Parquet files are written under a per-topic prefix in the configured `ObjectStore`.
    - `danube-iceberg-storage/src/topic_reader.rs`: `TopicReader::new()` now accepts the configured `ObjectStore`; removed hardcoded `LocalFileSystem`.
    - `danube-iceberg-storage/src/iceberg_storage.rs`: Wires `WriterConfig`, `ReaderConfig`, `warehouse`, and `ObjectStore` into `TopicWriter` and `TopicReader`.
  - Apply Writer/Reader configs:
    - `TopicWriter`: uses `WriterConfig.batch_size`, `WriterConfig.flush_interval_ms`, and enforces `WriterConfig.max_memory_bytes` with a flush-before-exceed policy.
    - `TopicReader`: uses `ReaderConfig.poll_interval_ms`, implements `ReaderConfig.max_concurrent_reads` via a semaphore, and uses a bounded prefetch queue sized by `ReaderConfig.prefetch_size`.

- Implemented real Iceberg REST commit protocol (add-files):
  - `danube-iceberg-storage/src/catalog.rs`: Extended `IcebergCatalog` with `commit_add_files(...)`.
  - `danube-iceberg-storage/src/catalog/rest_catalog.rs`: Implemented `POST /v1/namespaces/{ns}/tables/{table}/commit` using requirements (`assert-table-uuid`, optional `assert-ref-snapshot-id`) and an `add` operation with `data-files`.
  - `danube-iceberg-storage/src/catalog/glue_catalog.rs`: Added a clear `not implemented` error for `commit_add_files` with guidance to use REST for commits.
  - `danube-iceberg-storage/src/topic_writer.rs`: Switched `flush_batch()` to call `commit_add_files` with a `DataFile` for the written Parquet instead of synthesizing snapshots and calling `update_table`.

- Implemented reader incremental processing and Parquet read path (initial version):
  - `danube-iceberg-storage/src/topic_reader.rs`:
    - Enumerates new Parquet files by listing `{topic}/data` in the configured `ObjectStore`, prevents duplicates with an in-memory `seen_files` set, and reads files concurrently with the configured semaphore and prefetch queue.
    - Reads Parquet bytes using `ParquetRecordBatchReaderBuilder` and converts Arrow `RecordBatch` rows to `StreamMessage`.

- Notes:
  - Reader incremental scan currently uses object store prefix listing for new files. Next step is to strictly parse Iceberg manifest lists/manifests for added/deleted files and sequence numbers.
  - Glue commit is not implemented; use REST catalog for committing data in this phase.
  - Parquet compression/encoding is still at defaults; expose via config in a later step.

## Remaining Work (Tracking Checklist)

- [x] WAL reader: `read_next()` and `seek()`; periodic fsync in WAL
- [x] Stream wiring: connect `TopicReader` to subscribers; fan-out/backpressure
- [x] Config usage: pass object store to reader; use `warehouse` for table/data paths
- [x] Apply Writer/Reader configs (`WriterConfig`, `ReaderConfig`)
- [x] Enforce WriterConfig.max_memory_bytes (flush-before-exceed policy)
- [x] ReaderConfig.max_concurrent_reads and prefetch buffer
- [x] Iceberg REST commit protocol (manifests, manifest list, atomic ref update)
- [x] Reader incremental processing and Parquet -> `StreamMessage` (initial: prefix listing)
- [ ] Reader incremental processing from manifests (precise added/deleted files, sequence semantics)
- [ ] Committed position tracking and reporting
- [ ] `delete_topic()` drops table and cleans object store
- [ ] Catalog auth (REST token), AWS credentials/profile; retries/backoff

## Next Phase (Phase 3: Integration and Robustness)

- Precise reader incrementals via Iceberg manifests
  - Parse manifest list and manifests to enumerate only newly added data files since the last processed snapshot, and handle deletes.
  - Respect sequence numbers and snapshot lineage.
- Committed position tracking and etcd integration
  - Persist per-subscription progress (last snapshot/file/offset) to etcd and expose `get_committed_position()`.
  - Use etcd on startup to resume from the correct position.
- Operational robustness
  - Add REST token auth header support and AWS credentials/profile selection.
  - Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient REST/object_store failures.
  - Implement `delete_topic()` to drop the table and optionally purge warehouse prefixes.
- Observability and performance
  - Add tracing spans and metrics (commit latency, read lag, WAL flush stats, object_store IO).
  - Add integration tests (local FS + MinIO/REST) and basic performance benchmarks.

## Migration Path

The implementation maintains backward compatibility through:

1. **Dual storage support**: Legacy StorageBackend and new PersistentStorage traits
2. **Configuration-driven selection**: Broker can use either storage backend
3. **Gradual rollout**: Topics can be migrated individually
4. **Adapter pattern**: PersistentStorageAdapter bridges the interfaces

## Production Readiness
