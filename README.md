# Danube

Danube is an open-source distributed Messaging Broker platform (inspired by Apache Pulsar).
Danube is designed for high-performance and scalable message queueing, suitable for event-driven applications. It supports both message queueing and fan-out pub-sub systems, making it versatile for various use cases.

Check-out [the Docs](https://danube-docs.dev-state.com/) for more details of the Danube Architecture and the supported concepts.

* **Topics**: A unit of storage that organizes messages into a stream.
  * **Non-partitioned topics**: Served by a single broker.
  * **Partitioned topics**: Divided into partitions, served by different brokers within the cluster, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance.
* **Message Dispatch**:
  * **Non-reliable Message Dispatch**: Messages reside in memory and are promptly distributed to consumers, ideal for scenarios where speed is crucial. The acknowledgement mechanism is ignored.
  * **Reliable Message Dispatch**: The acknowledgement mechanism is used to ensure message delivery. Supports configurable storage options including in-memory, disk, and S3, ensuring message persistence and durability.
* **Subscription Types:**:
  * Supports various subscription types (exclusive, shared, failover) enabling different messaging patterns such as message queueing and pub-sub.
* **Flexible Message Schemas**
  * Supports multiple message schemas (bytes, string, int64, JSON) providing flexibility in message format and structure.

## Clients

Allows single or multiple Producers to publish on the Topic and multiple Subscriptions to consume the messages from the Topic.

![Producers  Consumers](https://danube-docs.dev-state.com/architecture/img/producers_consumers.png "Producers Consumers")

You can combine the [Subscription Type mechanisms](https://danube-docs.dev-state.com/architecture/Queuing_PubSub_messaging/) in order to obtain message queueing or fan-out pub-sub messaging systems.

Currently, the Danube client libraries are written in:

* [Rust Client](https://crates.io/crates/danube-client) - the Rust [examples](danube-client/examples/) on how to create and use the Producers / Consumers
* [Go Client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/danrusei/danube-go) - the Go [examples](https://github.com/danrusei/danube-go/tree/main/examples) on how to create and use the Producers / Consumers

### Community supported clients

Contributions in other languages, such as Python, Java, etc., are also greatly appreciated. If there are any I'll add in this section.

## Danube CLIs

* **Command-Line Interfaces (CLI)**
  * [**Danube CLI**](https://github.com/danube-messaging/danube/tree/main/danube-cli): For handling message publishing and consumption.
  * [**Danube Admin CLI**](https://github.com/danube-messaging/danube/tree/main/danube-admin-cli): For managing and interacting with the Danube cluster, including broker, namespace, and topic management.

## Development environment

Continuously working on enhancing and adding new features.

**Contributions are welcome**, check [the open issues](https://github.com/danube-messaging/danube/issues) or report a bug you encountered or a needed feature.
